# nwc-poc - base root module shared by the three features (pipeline / agent / workflow). VPC with 3 private subnets (a, b, c),
# no route to the internet (no NAT Gateway, no IGW, no inbound path), the S3 gateway endpoint and the interface
# endpoints for the AWS APIs, the network perimeter (perimeter.tf - deny outside aws:SourceVpc), one security group per
# workload plus one for the endpoints (security_groups.tf - rules from a flow table), VPC flow logs (flow_logs.tf), the chat web EC2 (Gradio: chat + topology figure + device table, 127.0.0.1 only, reached through SSM Session Manager
# port forwarding), the shared S3 bucket and the IAM roles the features attach policies to.
# The AgentCore Runtime, guardrail and optional knowledge base are terraform/agent; the lab / stream / analytics / graph
# roots are the pipeline; Temporal on ECS is terraform/workflow. Each of them reads this state (terraform_remote_state).

# リソース名の接頭辞であり Project タグの値。デプロイする人の名前（var.owner）から作るので、
# 1 つの AWS アカウントを何人かで使っても、自分の名前で自分のリソースを探せる
